# Can Interracial Parasocial Interactions in Video Games Reduce Prejudice and Promote Support for Anti-Racism? A Study Proposal

This proposed study examines whether playing a video game with a Black non-player character reduces prejudice and increase anti-racism support among White people.


# Abstract
  Video games can be a powerful art medium where players safely learn about racial out-groups—their stories, beliefs, values, and social norms without concerns of appearing as a racist. In video games, players can interact with out-group characters and form parasocial connections, which then theoretically could reduce out-group bias and increase support for antiracist social movements. However, other research suggested that White people may experience negative emotions in interracial interactions, which could then lead to disengagement and less support for anti-racism. In the proposed study, I will examine whether White people who interact with Black characters report lower prejudice towards Black people and higher support for anti-racism movements (e.g., Black Lives Matter and Kick Out Zwarte Piet) compared with those who play a video game with White characters only. I will also measure participants’ heart rate variability as a correlate for emotion regulation while playing the video game. I expect that participants with higher (vs. lower) heart rate variability while interacting with a Black character will report lower prejudice and higher support for anti-racism.
